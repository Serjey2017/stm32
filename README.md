STM32F103Z
==========

My repository for learning STM32F103Z microcontroller using a GNU/Linux based development envronment. It aims to show how to work with this cortex-M3 based micontroller using only free tools.

In particular there are two workspaces:

* workspace_eclipse: eclipse projects based StdPeriph library

* workspace_libopencm3: projects based on [libopencm3] (https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) library

Both rely on GCC toolchain and OpenOCD.

My hardware set consists of:

* STM32F103Z based board (bought on [WaveShare](http://www.wvshare.com/column/STM32_DevelopmentBoard.htm#Open103Z))
* ST-LINK/V2 debugger and programmer.
