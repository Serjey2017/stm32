Setup development environment
-----------------------------

Here are some instructions to have on a Linux host a complete development environment based on this toolset:

* Eclipse
* GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain
* OpenOCD

for this target device:
* STM32F103 based board (bought on [WaveShare](http://www.wvshare.com/column/STM32_DevelopmentBoard.htm#Open103Z))
* ST-LINK/V2 debugger and programmer
