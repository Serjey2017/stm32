STM32F103Z
==========

My repository for learning STM32F103Z microcontroller using a GNU/Linux based development envronment. It aims to show how to work with this cortex-M3 based micontroller using only free tools.

In particular there are two workspaces:

*workspace_eclipse: eclipse projects based StdPeriph library

*workspace_libopencm3: projects based on libopencm3 library

Both rely on GCC toolchain and OpenOCD debugger.
